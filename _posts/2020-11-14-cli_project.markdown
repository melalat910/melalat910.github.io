When I first started the project I was very confused about what exactly the goal of it was. I thought scraping and getting data from an API was the same thing (still not too clear on the difference). I also got hung up on just about every obstacle that was pointed out in the video demos such as understanding how to clone the repository, push to GitHub and find the right API. But after that, I narrowed down an API source after changing ideas twice from Google Maps and NASA to a Covid -19 tracker, I went with this data because it is socially relevant to make a program for this information and I recently recovered from it so, my decision was made easily. My Covid_19_cases project is installed when bin/run is excuted, it allows users to find up-to-date information on new and total confirmed, deaths and recoveries of Covid-19 cases by country. User is greeted and asked to see info on coronavirus cases by country by selecting the number of that country. When done the program will exit and "Wear a mask!" will be the exit message. For future projects, I plan to work on time management  so that I will not be incovienced by another hurricane like I was during the second project week, I alotted that week to go over code and get help from peers but I missed out on it because of a 3-day power outtage. I will timing myself when completing certain tasks and shave off time spent of research. Also I think I need to find a sort of mentor to answer all my dumb technical questions  so that I wont have to procrastinate about asking my teacher or peers about small problems.
